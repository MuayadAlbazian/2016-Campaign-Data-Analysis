       "6       Listening to @nehanarkhede talk about event streams at #ATO2016 and thinking about how to continue evolving our Kafka-based pipeline.Related, man would I love to have @erinscafe as a coach for my kids.If youre interested in processing streaming data at scale, @MailChimp is hiring: https://t.co/MYxL4mCkaC Come see us if youre at #ATO2016.@rachaelmaddux Just when I think I couldnt love her more.If you coach or have kids in youth sports, this is well worth reading. https://t.co/BEdjKmZ28H@_raven_io @pwnela Im well past the three month mark and still not sure Im setwhich is cool, but could be distressing if unexpected.Moving on to discussion of IoT, ML, and AR by @GregU. (Lots of buzzwords there.) Just learning of @PTC's acquisition of @Vuforia. #ATO2016Wish @nehanarkhede had asked how many were actively using Kafka. I suspect it would have still been sizable. https://t.co/OVy8zXHeiT@erinscafe @salrelish I'm pretty reserved, but if this happened to a team I coached or had kid onI don't know how I'd handle it. Appalling.@KyFaSt Congrats! Super happy for you and happy to get to work with you as any sort of engineeror just plain person.Starting day at #ATO2016. Looking forward to keynotesparticularly @nehanarkhede and talks through the day. Come see us at @MailChimp booth@SwiftOnSecurity @dcloues Wow. Imagine the world in which cat pictures are the stupidest thing. Can one get transferred into that world?@nehanarkhede @jessfraz Wondered whether you'd mention in your keynote. LOLed when you did.Also related, youth sports is full of coaches like @erinscafe who give so much time and care to kids. The bad ones shouldn't be tolerated.@nehanarkhede Im hoping that wasnt as cringeworthy at I fear it was. Looking forward to your keynote.Just listened to @solrac901  discuss @ApacheSpot. Thinking of possible new applications for ML at @MailChimp. #ATO2016@adickerson  @ComfortablySmug I could not be more intrigued than by a topic recommended by both Drudge and @jdickerson.@skamille cats don't care. Just look at the expression.@Michael_Tsunam1 @samnesmith Important clarification. I was concerned for a bit there.@bakins Im so sorry.@JessicaMauerhan If youre still around and interested, I held some swag for you at the booth.

Not that used to twitter yet...I can message, right?Oh boy, here we go. https://t.co/E3TnIYaMHU@brentitude Only reason I'm watching #Maddow this evening, but this is a bit much. Hope it doesn't influence election, but here we are.Far better to switch over to the #Simpsons after these political shows. Even some good #TalkingHeads in the soundtrack;) #SimpsonsHalloweenAs I struggle to get daughter's school to help get her home, due to my health, but not worry abt her googling 4 https://t.co/s6zQeDuM7Q@helmicmom Exactly! Though I used to also get asked if I was .@SarahKSilverman often. That also fits your description.Wow, people put me on a lot of lists here. Is that a good thing? Bad thing? What are these lists, anyway?My husband doing a @PeepsForum talk on #semiotics (he looks pretty adorable): https://t.co/c62V78Q0p9  #symbols #Anthropology #Ethnography@realDonaldTrump don't even think abt repealing the #preexisting condition aspect. Not sure how you can repeal & not do that. Explain?With the time frame involved, there were others who messed up privacy/email & server issues.

Stick to the plan, it's a careful decision! https://t.co/cwGHn2k0gv #motivation #hope #inspired5 other side, only way I could go further back is to be #Indegenous. As for joining the #UDC, or #SCV relatives, well, I don't agree with4 for #Hemingway, #Fitzgerald (#ZeldaFitzgerald also), #BenHur, flappers and #suffragettes all. Americans here 5 generations. As for theGreat moment. #TWD #TheWalkingDead https://t.co/39PTcnrNeR@helmicmom I'd say I'm shocked, but......Oh no, this is certain to give me the giggles. When good old German pronunciations go slightly awry. #maddowAs you can see from video, my fight for #healthcare has been (still is) hard enough. I won't stop fighting against the preexisting issue.@brentitude Mine are learning, but we're politically active, family (& friends) in @StateDept also, so we never slack off there!Pre-existing conditions MATTER. #healthcare  #ObamacareInThreeWordsReally, I just wanted the pins & sign but also to share #awareness for our hip #healthcare issues w @HillaryClinton. Instead, I got emails.Leave @RepDuckworth alone! Lots of us multiracial #DAR members- shouldn't even BE an issue in her case. #AmericanHero #MarkKirk #innersReading for me, now. TIme to get that #nonprofit  off the ground! #hips #hope #healthcare #HipArthroscopy https://t.co/0NXeYiipuYThis just might work....

Why haven't I found you sooner??#Alabama ballot 2016: if you force residents to travel for #healthcare we can buy lottery tix whenever we want. Take that.@helmicmom It's odd, isn't it? Ppl don't realize this leaves a mark. Not always a bad one, but it leaves an awareness of race.@brentitude cont.. impress on my kids the importance of studying the political process! How debased now. Daughter wants to go @StateDept.Another reminder: #HipArthroscopy patients CAN'T get through this surgery w/o #caregivers, often also travel! This https://t.co/XTQBbcKqENI like this show usually, I love @kurteichenwald, but this is too much. Donate & THEN you'll get sick of Hillary's emails. #lastwordNot Just Insurance #ObamacareInThreeWordsSad that a veteran of #TammyDuckworth's integrity & heroism would be attacked on racial grounds at all. #MarkKIrk #inners@helmicmom Which begs the question, \"What IS a \"stereotypical African American\"? & how are individuals supposed to act like one?Not sure why I remember when it's this awesome guy's birthday, but I always do!

Deal with it!)@VABVOX Really like the #CripTheVote tag!

Ppl can have ancestry back to Jamestown & still be 1/2 non-Anglo? #inners@helmicmom Thanks for tweeting back, it's an odd subject more finally discussing. What do you say/do in return? What's your experience been?@helmicmom No, really nothing at this point. Very shameful. I've had to say similar things (no #DAR statue to me obviously) to more racists.Promoted tweet freaking me out. I keep thinking someone's made a ribcage vacuum cleaner here. Actually, someone do https://t.co/3BtKpTfCV9Oooh, I like this link! My husband is in it. Check this out! #Anthropology #Ethnography https://t.co/aduCwhK1wk@helmicmom You start getting REALLY odd questions after 9/11? That's when the real fun began for me. \"Are you Israeli or Palestinian?\" EH??Once they had doppelganger day on facebook, so I put up #SarahSilverman's pic. No one got it, they just told me they liked my hair that way.@brentitude I wouldn't! There's a lot of \"eww\" going on here. Might have to duck out.

Many in FLA b4 Castro, b4 Revolution.@helmicmom sadly, yes. Even 5th gen. & 13th gen., some expect me to fit some stereotype. I do fit a stereotype, being American.@YaelTAbouhalkah If you don't mind, I'll continue to follow & keep up w/ #ksleg here while pretending I never moved to Bama.

Gosh, I still don't care about these emails.... sorry. #maddow@helmicmom are some earliest memories. + my AMERICAN red headed Grandfather (of Cuban descent) yelling, \"SHE'S AMERICAN!\" He gets reverse!7 for revisionist history. The only revision I want is surgery for my left leg, dammit. I want to walk again!  End rant on #ethnic #Heritage6 the #CSA in #CivilWar (apparently still a topic where I've moved) of the idea of owning human beings. I'm injured, not inhuman.

Is there a contest for that? TIA. #healthcare #hipinjuries https://t.co/vL3QlwH9Rr@VABVOX as I fill out my absentee ballot, I also want to tweet a TY for this great article! (@MCACBham, great read here!) #LGBTQ #GOTVRest of me? English. Southern. #Jamestown & #OldVirginia. Fought in #AmericanRevolution. #DAR & eligible (but would NEVER join) #UDC. 1/28 & all support to #TammyDuckworth defending her own! Disgusting that it was brought up by #MarkKirk. Leave a real #AmericanHero alone!@brentitude I got an absentee ballot (new injury), plenty i know have already voted early. Quite right, doubt there could be many undecided.@helmicmom They see what they want, they also expect you to fit 1 category. I fit 3 ethnic/racially, & weird ??s about \"what are you?\" 1/2Full disclosure: I deleted some of Hillary's emails. I bought some pins, yard sign...they wouldn't stop & got pretty annoying. #Hillary2016Can that be done w/o wiping away the #preexisting clause & getting ppl dropped who face surgeries or other expensiv https://t.co/Q9rqcfp1xIWon't you start today....you say that tomorrow you'll do it, but you never get to it. #motivation #PositiveVibes #Gazelle #genoeg #hope@brentitude Not sure abt other families. I'm guessing my Uncle is glad they didn't use emails during his @StateDept career....lol. #maddow@brentitude Missed having our kids watch 1 #GOP debate, glad we did. It was the one with the \"size\" discussions. & there I was trying (cont)@VABVOX Just found your account, sorry for the questions, you report from Philly? & on #healthcare matters & #awareness?Protects Millions w Preexisting  #ObamacareInThreeWordsOh, come on. This had promise to be funny. Boring Hillary memes are just that. Maybe they're the #SignsAtTheGatesOfHell ??@brentitude There is a LOVELY Obama conspiracy theory he figures into online (it's all false but hilariously so). Obama's mom, actually. OddAlso, no intention of discussing #Heritage as pertains to #CivilWar, the #South or neo-#Confederate issues, except that they should let up.I don't think that's why #hillarysemail is trending, but I got bored, so there you have it. #ImWithHer#Healthcare  Isn't Political (or at least mine & yours shouldn't be!)  #ObamacareInThreeWords3 grad an American Uni.

       "164781  ...It's pretty amazing.It showed me she actually listened to what I was saying, gave it thought and is willing to make changes to avoid perpetuating the problem.I hadn't been offended by her remarks, knowing her intentions to be good; but the apology really moved me.Well I didn't mean it THAT way- \"You have to look at both sides-\" \"Don't be so sensitive!\"@Davis43M the dude chanting USA USA USA and starting a party in the background is my favorite part@Davis43M THIS. https://t.co/zhykaTm47hSweet little girl-person, waiting quietly in the wings to enter this all-too-big world... Aunt Sassy can't wait to https://t.co/IjTh82Yk1wI know they don't mean to hurt. Most of my community has been very supportive of my coming out. It just doesn't always click.@Bibliogato Matt Smith is in it so HELL YES I'm looking forwardThis is delightful. https://t.co/q6sGmF7byESo I usually just say nothing. Why bring it up and start an argument, that will only lead to bruised feelings on both sides?I can only hope to someday be as utterly, perfectly content in life as my cat is in a pile of dirty laundry.@KimESTAqui Yeah. It's an inner struggle every time I'm faced with a situation like that... especially since it usually happens at work@KimESTAqui It really is. I think it's actually harder, and more powerful, to apologise for & learn from mistakes than to never make them.And then I laid my head down on the computer keyboard and wept.So, when I do make myself vulnerable enough to say \"Hey, this kinda hurt\" and be met with genuine desire to understand, to listen...When I realize a patron has walked off with my pen: https://t.co/isHqeBqGHf@KimESTAqui ...and while I might not have qualms about expressing opinions on my own time, when I'm in professional capacity the line blurs.A lot of today sucked... but a lot was also wonderful.  Life is funny that way.Also, in other the-world-isn't-a-totally-sucky-place-I-guess news: I came home to a sonogram of my NIECE....and she listened, and though it's new territory for her she was sympathetic and asked questions to better understand my perspective......and later blew me away by pulling me aside and apologising for some comments she had made before, that she now realized might have hurt.Some days go your way... and some days your phone dies, & a favorite patron makes thoughtless homophobic comments, & the world just hurts.Too often, when I talk to my straight, conservative friends & family about queer discrimination or erasure, their response is to argue.
